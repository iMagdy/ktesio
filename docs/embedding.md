title: Embedding the Engine
description: Drive the Ktesio engine as a Rust library — the facade surface, the event bus, and the hermetic quickstart example.

# Embedding the Engine

Ktesio is a library first and a CLI second: the `kt` binary is itself just an
embedder that drives the engine's public Rust facade. A hosting platform can do
the same — register agents, configure them, enforce token and dollar budgets,
subscribe to lifecycle events, and supervise processes, with no CLI, no TTY, and
no prompts. This page is the quickstart; the flow-level guarantees are covered
in [Architecture](architecture.md).

## Adding the dependency

Until the crates are published to crates.io, depend on this repository pinned
to an exact revision:

```toml
[dependencies]
ktesio-engine = "0.1"
```

Pin a **full-length commit SHA**, never a branch: a pinned `rev` makes your
build reproducible and upgrades deliberate (the engine's public surface is
CI-guarded against breaking changes between freezes, but a moving target is
still a moving target).

**Which SHA to pin:** the embedding surface (the `blocking()` facade plus the
event bus) stabilized at commit `8a8b328` — story 7-3's freeze, now guarded by
the CI semver gate against that exact baseline. Pin **any commit at or after
it**; the newest `main` commit you are comfortable with is the right default.
To fetch a current full SHA to pin:

```bash
git rev-parse origin/main
```

(paste the full 40-character output as your `rev`). After the publish executes
(see [the release runbook](release-process.md#publishing-the-engine-crates)),
switch to the versioned crates.io form — the facade you compile against does
not change:

```toml
[dependencies]
ktesio-engine = "0.1"
```

Two things to know before depending: the engine's minimum supported Rust is
**1.96.1** (the workspace `rust-version`; any toolchain at or above it
builds), and Ktesio is **source-available**, not open source — the
[Ktesio Noncommercial-Attribution License 1.0.0](../LICENSE) keeps
noncommercial use free and requires the author's written approval for
commercial use.

Only `ktesio-engine` is needed. It is a normal Rust dependency — the engine
never touches your TTY, never reads stdin, holds no global process state, and
several engines can live in one process side by side, each rooted at its own
state directory.

## The facade surface

Open an engine with `Engine::open(base)` and either call its `async` methods on
your own runtime or take `engine.blocking()` for a synchronous view — the same
surface `kt` uses. The capabilities you will reach for first:

| Facade | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `Engine::open(base)` | Open (or create) an engine rooted at a state directory; `None` uses the OS default. |
| `register` / `register_with_adapter` | Register an instance under a built-in adapter kind or a manifest (`adapter.toml`) directory. |
| `set_config` / `effective_config` | Write and read the unified configuration (budgets, rates, model keys) with per-leaf provenance. |
| `start` / `stop` / `pause` / `resume` | Drive the lifecycle; `stop` takes a graceful-shutdown window and kills the whole process group. |
| `subscribe` / `Blocking::subscribe` | Receive the event stream (below). |
| `resync_events` / `Blocking::resync_events` | Backfill the committed events a subscriber missed (below). |
| `with_diagnostics` / `Blocking::with_diagnostics` | Route the engine's two stderr diagnostics into your own writer (below). |
| `fleet` / `instance_status` | Read per-instance rows — state, usage, budget remaining, metering source — what `kt agent list` renders. |
| `budget_breach_events` / `transition_events` / `read_agent_log` | Query the durable records directly (a `subscribe` sees only later commits; the query APIs reach the past). |
| `send_input` / `attach_memory` / `detach_memory` | Interaction and memory wiring, where the adapter declares support. |

Every method returns a typed `Result` — the engine reports partial failures
with a reason and a remediation instead of panicking.

## The event bus

`engine.subscribe()` hands you a receiver over a bounded, ordered event bus.
Four rules cover the whole contract:

1. **Subscribe before it happens.** A receiver observes only events committed
   after it subscribed, in commit order, per-instance FIFO. Anything earlier is
   readable through the query APIs.
2. **Payloads are versioned structs.** Every event carries a `schema_version`
   and is one of: a lifecycle transition, a budget breach, or a committed
   usage measurement — the exact wire shapes `kt --json` documents.
3. **A slow subscriber never stalls supervision.** The bus is bounded; if you
   fall more than its capacity behind, your next receive observes `Lagged` and
   resynchronizes at the tail — the dropped events stay readable in the
   durable logs. Drain promptly or poll `try_recv` on your own cadence.
4. **Delivery is at-most-once in the crash window — and recoverable.** Events
   are appended to the durable record first, then published; a process crash
   between the two loses that one event from the *stream*. The durable record
   stays complete, and `resync_events` (below) heals the window in one call.
   Treat the stream as a live notification surface, with the resync as your
   gap remedy.

## Healing the crash window: `resync_events`

Rule 4 above leaves a gap: events committed while nobody was subscribed (or
while your subscriber's process was down) never reach the stream. The engine
ships the remedy — one call reads the instance's COMMITTED event records (the
same truth the query APIs serve: transitions, breaches, ledger rows) and
returns them as the exact event payloads the live bus delivers:

```rust
use ktesio_engine::{Blocking, ResyncCursor};

// 1. Backfill everything committed so far …
let batch = facade.resync_events("my-agent", ResyncCursor::START)?;
for event in &batch.events {
    // transition / budget breach / usage update — the same shapes the
    // live stream carries.
}

// 2. …THEN subscribe live. That order is the contract: the backfill is
//    precisely the prefix and the live stream precisely the suffix, so the
//    combined window has no gap and no duplicate.
let mut events = facade.subscribe();
```

The contract, in five rules:

1. **Committed truth only.** A read-side helper over the same durable records
   the query APIs return — the bus is untouched. An event whose append failed
   never appears in a backfill either.
2. **Ordering is exact per family.** Transitions come in `instance.log` order,
   breaches in `breaches.log` order, usage updates in ledger commit order —
   the same orders the stream guarantees. Across families the batch is
   family-major (transitions, then breaches, then usage): the durable record
   carries no global cross-family sequence, and the engine does not fabricate
   one. This is exactly why rule 2 of the usage pattern above is "subscribe
   after backfill" — that order needs no cross-family ordering inside the
   backfill. Subscribing first is not corrupting, only overlapping
   (duplicates, never gaps — your window, your dedup).
3. **Cursor-based and idempotent.** The returned batch carries a
   `ResyncCursor`; pass it to the next call and the already-consumed prefix is
   skipped, so re-running a resync never re-delivers. Persist the cursor
   across your own restarts if you like (it serializes).
4. **Crash-recovery read posture.** The helper is called most often right
   after the crash it heals — and that crash can tear the log's trailing
   append. One unparseable trailing line per log is skipped (that record is
   absent from the durable truth too); a malformed interior line is a typed
   error worth investigating.
5. **Per-instance.** `name` scopes the read; a Fleet-wide backfill is your
   loop over instances. An unregistered name fails `NotFound` rather than
   reading as a silent empty backfill.

## The diagnostic sink

The engine writes exactly two operational diagnostics — a DC-10 notice when an
attached filesystem memory backing cannot be delivered to the agent, and an
enforcement breadcrumb when a budget-breach action (pause/stop) could not be
honored. With no sink installed they go to **stderr**, byte-for-byte as they
always have; nothing is written to stdout, ever. A host that owns its stderr
(for a daemon, a GUI, a log pipeline) can route both into its own writer:

```rust
use ktesio_engine::{DiagnosticSink, Engine};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

// Any std::io::Write works — a file, a channel, an in-memory buffer.
let sink: DiagnosticSink = Arc::new(Mutex::new(Box::new(std::io::sink())));

// Either install at open (the airtight form — in place before any
// supervision work, including orphan adoption and the crash reaper):
let engine = Engine::open_with_diagnostics(Some(state_dir), sink.clone())?;

// …or install/rotate on an already-open engine:
engine.blocking().with_diagnostics(sink);
```

The contract, in five rules:

1. **Exact texts.** Each diagnostic arrives as one full line — the same
   `[ktesio] `-prefixed text stderr would have received, `\n`-terminated. A
   sink that mirrors its input reproduces the default output byte-for-byte.
2. **Opt-in, additive.** Installing nothing changes nothing; the default path
   is pinned by CI as byte-identical to the historical engine.
3. **Thread-safe by construction.** The sink is an `Arc<Mutex<Box<dyn Write +
   Send>>>`, so the engine can emit from any supervision thread and you can
   clone the `Arc` to share one sink across engines. Diagnostics are rare —
   the lock is never a hot path.
4. **Never re-enter the engine from the writer.** Emissions happen while the
   engine's supervisor lock is held; a `write` that calls back into the engine
   would deadlock. Forwarding the line to your own channel or lock is fine.
5. **Best-effort, like the diagnostics themselves.** A write error is
   swallowed (supervision never fails or blocks on a broken sink), and no
   diagnostic is ever the durable record of anything — the transition, breach,
   and usage logs remain the authoritative copies, readable via the query
   APIs.

## The quickstart example

A complete, runnable host lives at
[`crates/ktesio-engine/examples/embedding-quickstart.rs`](https://github.com/iMagdy/ktesio/blob/main/crates/ktesio-engine/examples/embedding-quickstart.rs).
Run it from the repository root:

```bash
cargo run -p ktesio-engine --example embedding-quickstart
```

It is deliberately dependency-free — no `kt`, no test fixtures, no helper
crates, not even `tempfile` — so it shows exactly what a host depends on. The
seven legs, matching the numbered steps in the file:

1. **Open**: a scratch state root (a per-process directory under the OS temp
   dir, cleaned up best-effort at the end) and `Engine::open(Some(root))`
   with the blocking facade.
2. **Register** a manifest adapter: the example writes a minimal
   `contract_version = "1.0.0"` `adapter.toml` (see
   [the manifest reference](manifest.md) and the
   [Adapter Contract](adapter-contract.md)) whose `[lifecycle.start]` command
   re-executes the example binary itself as a stand-in agent — a real host
   points that field at its own agent executable. (The engine's built-in
   kinds, such as `hermes`, register with `AdapterRef::Native` instead.)
3. **Configure** one budget key — `budget.tokens.cumulative = 100000` — and
   assert the `effective_config` read-back (value and provenance layer).
4. **Subscribe** before starting, so the transition events are observable.
5. **Start**: the engine spawns the manifest's `[lifecycle.start]` command
   and reaches `running` before the call returns.
6. **Observe**: drain the committed events (`Lagged` resyncs at the tail and
   keeps draining), then assert `instance_status` is `running` and the
   `fleet` row carries the configured budget ceiling.
7. **Stop** with a five-second graceful window, then remove the scratch root
   (best-effort).

CI compiles the example on all three OS legs and **runs** it hermetically on
ubuntu on every push — the quickstart cannot silently rot.

## The boundary is the guarantee

What a host can reach is enforced by the compiler, not by convention: the
engine's private modules are Rust-private, so **if you cannot name it, you
cannot call it** — a host compiles against exactly the same public API `kt`
does. Four instruments keep that statement honest:

- **The dependency-shape gate** — CI's `boundary` job allowlists the internal
  edges of the shipped CLI's graph (`cargo tree`), so `kt` cannot quietly grow
  a dependency on anything but the engine, the adapter-contract types, and the
  built-in hermes adapter; a future internal crate fails the gate
  automatically ([the workflow](https://github.com/iMagdy/ktesio/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
- **The facade audits** — the embed-clean suites prove `kt` consumes only the
  blocking facade (no async APIs, no runtime of its own) and that every async
  method has a blocking counterpart, with no TTY, prompt, or global-state
  escapes.
- **The library-alone flow proof** — a host test drives the full
  register → configure → cap → start → breach → pause → stop journey through
  the facade alone and shares its assertions with the CLI suite, proving the
  library path and the CLI path behave identically
  ([the host test](https://github.com/iMagdy/ktesio/blob/main/crates/ktesio-engine/tests/uj3_library_host.rs)).
- **The semver gate** — CI diffs both public crates' surfaces against their
  freeze baselines, so a breaking change cannot land unnoticed.
