//! The THIRD-PARTY adapter simulation (story 6-4, AC line 4): this file is what
//! an external adapter crate's dev-test looks like. It compiles against
//! `ktesio-conformance` ALONE (this crate's own manifest adapter is the
//! third-party shape — a directory holding an `adapter.toml` that execs the
//! conformance `fake_agent`), imports ONLY the public TCK surface, and asserts
//! on the returned [`ConformanceReport`] — the "cargo test harness any
//! third-party adapter crate can invoke" contract, with no private helper, no
//! test-runner framework, and no macros.
//!
//! The manifest below is authored from scratch (the way a real adapter author
//! would write theirs): a launchable `[lifecycle.start]` carrying the harness's
//! `--dump <path>` delivery-evidence pair, a per-OS Capability Declaration, a
//! self-reported Metering Source, and the declared `[config]` rules (the
//! documented `model` key plus the reserved `memory.dir` key) whose delivery
//! the report proves.
