//! # The Conformance Test Kit (TCK) — story 6-4, FR-27
//!
//! A **compliance report**, not a test framework: the harness registers a
//! caller-provided adapter with a FRESH engine over a hermetic temp state root,
//! drives every section a live adapter can be held to, and returns a
//! machine-readable [`ConformanceReport`] whose per-section entries are
//! `pass` / `fail(reason)` / `not_applicable(reason)`. The caller's `#[test]`
//! asserts on the report — this keeps the TCK usable from any third-party
//! adapter crate's dev-tests against `ktesio-conformance` alone.
//!
//! ## Applicability is derived, never hardcoded
//!
//! Every section consults the adapter's DECLARATION (the effective per-OS
//! projection + [`MeteringSource`], read from the engine's registered
//! snapshot) to decide pass/fail/not-applicable. That is what makes the same
//! harness honest for the shipping `hermes` builtin (Pause BestEffort is still
//! APPLICABLE — it must demonstrate the best-effort cause tags, not skip) and
//! for a manifest adapter (EngineObserved metering is not_applicable while it
//! declares SelfReported).
//!
//! ## Who is under test in each section (subject vs probe twins)
//!
//! Plainly: **four sections demonstrate the CALLER'S adapter itself**, and
//! **four prove the engine seam through TCK-authored probe twins**. Nothing
//! mutates the caller's adapter.
//!
//! * Caller's adapter (registered as `tck-subject`): `capability_edges`
//!   (its persisted projection), `lifecycle` (its start/stop transitions; the
//!   crash leg uses a TCK-authored twin so the caller's process is never
//!   deliberately killed), `pause` (its process is paused/resumed; the
//!   real-suspension freeze proof uses a TCK heartbeat probe), and
//!   `config_mapping` for manifest subjects (its OWN declared rules are set
//!   on it and proven through its dump artifact).
//! * TCK-authored probe twins (fresh registered instances in the same
//!   engine, each proving the SAME engine seam under the probe's own
//!   declaration): `metering_self_reported`, `metering_engine_observed`,
//!   `memory` (attach/deliver/detach on a twin declaring the reserved key),
//!   and `interaction` (echo on a twin declaring the level under test).
//!
//! A native (non-manifest) subject's config section reads not_applicable —
//! its code-declared launch offers no `--dump <path>` seam to observe
//! delivered config through.
//!
//! ## Sections
//!
//! * `capability_edges` — the persisted effective projection matches the
//!   declaration the adapter actually carries (OS + stability checks).
//! * `lifecycle` — start → running → stop → stopped, full transition-event
//!   sequence, plus the CRASH leg (a `Never`-policy twin whose process exits
//!   7 past the readiness window lands `failed` with a `crashed` cause,
//!   restart_count 0).
//! * `pause` — honest per the declared level: Guaranteed (Unix) proves a REAL
//!   suspension (heartbeat freeze) + plain command causes; BestEffort proves
//!   the transitions AND the `pause-best-effort` / `resume-best-effort`
//!   qualifier causes; Unsupported checks the level BEFORE starting the
//!   subject and reports `not_applicable` with a reason naming the
//!   declaration (the engine's fail-fast `CapabilityUnsupported` is honest
//!   behavior — the DECLARATION is the input the harness tests).
//! * `config_mapping` — the SUBJECT's own declared `[config]` env rules are
//!   set on the subject before start and proven delivered through the
//!   subject's own `--dump <path>` artifact; the `agent.*` pass-through key
//!   is proven verbatim (its tail IS the env var name). A manifest that
//!   accepts no `--dump <path>` cannot prove delivery and reports `fail`
//!   naming the gap.
//! * `metering_self_reported` — a probe emits 3 sentinel batches (10 in /
//!   20 out); the ledger and Fleet totals agree exactly; a replayed
//!   sequence-0 batch does not double-count.
//! * `metering_engine_observed` — for EngineObserved adapters only: a
//!   loopback upstream stub (Content-Length responses, the fixed 30/70/100
//!   usage body), the operator sets the real upstream, and 3 forwarded calls
//!   commit exactly.
//! * `memory` — attach → status reports the attachment AND the declared
//!   delivery fact → a probe with the same declaration receives the managed
//!   dir through its declared env var → detach clears it. Adapters that
//!   declare no `memory.dir` mapping read `not_applicable` (delivery is
//!   offered, not imposed).
//! * `interaction` — Guaranteed/BestEffort: send_input reaches a running
//!   agent (echo proof in its log); Unsupported: fails fast
//!   `CapabilityUnsupported` on a probe.
//!
//! A failed section NEVER aborts the suite: each section records its first
//! failure reason and the remaining sections still run (the report is the
//! product, not a panic).
