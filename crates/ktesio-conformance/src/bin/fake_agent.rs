//! `fake_agent` — a tiny, cross-platform, spawnable test agent (story 1.4, AD-3).
//!
//! A DEV/TEST artifact: the engine's start/stop integration tests point a
//! manifest adapter's `[lifecycle.start]` `exec` at this binary so the supervisor
//! spawns a REAL process to launch, supervise, and kill — proving supervision end
//! to end (1-3's `ScriptedFakeAgent` was inert). It is pure `std` with NO
//! OS-conditional code (the OS-cfg CI gate applies to `ktesio-conformance` too),
//! so it builds and runs identically on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
//!
//! ## Behaviors (selected by args)
//!
//! * (default) print a ready line to stdout, then loop-sleep "forever" (until the
//!   supervisor kills it) — proves `start → running` and `stop → killed`.
//! * `--exit-fast <code>`  exit immediately with `<code>` — proves AC2
//!   launch-failure / immediate non-zero exit during startup.
//! * `--spawn-child`  before looping, spawn ANOTHER copy of this binary (also
//!   looping) as a child — proves AC3 "no process of the instance survives"
//!   catches the WHOLE process group / Job, not just the parent PID. The child's
//!   pid is printed as `child-pid=<n>` so a test can assert the child is gone too.
//! * `--linger-ms <ms>`  after receiving no signal, keep running for at least
//!   `<ms>` before self-exiting. Tests set the stop window SHORTER than this so
//!   the graceful window elapses and the supervisor's forced kill is exercised —
//!   the cfg-free way to force escalation (a SIGTERM-ignoring handler would need
//!   OS-cfg, which the gate forbids here). With no `--linger-ms` the process
//!   loops effectively forever (a very long sleep), so a normal graceful stop
//!   still ends it promptly via the kill.
//! * `--heartbeat-ms <ms>`  print an incrementing `heartbeat <n>` line to stdout
//!   every `<ms>` and flush (story 1-5). When the process is SIGSTOP'd the whole
//!   process freezes, so its captured log STOPS growing; SIGCONT resumes it — the
//!   OBSERVABLE suspension proof for the guaranteed pause path. With no
//!   `--heartbeat-ms` the loop is a quiet sleep (existing 1-4 tests that only
//!   assert `ready`/lifecycle are unaffected). Pure `std`, NO OS-cfg.
//! * `--crash-after-ms <ms>` (+ optional `--crash-with <code>`)  run normally
//!   (announcing readiness, heartbeating if asked) for `<ms>`, THEN exit with
//!   `<code>` (default 1) — simulating an UNREQUESTED crash AFTER the readiness
//!   window (story 1-6). Distinct from `--exit-fast`, which exits DURING startup
//!   (a launch failure); `--crash-after-ms` stays alive long enough to reach
//!   `running`, so the supervisor's reaper detects the later `Exited` as a crash
//!   and the Restart Policy fires. The `--heartbeat-ms` line count proves a
//!   RESTARTED instance is alive again. Pure `std`, NO OS-cfg.
//!
//! The binary writes a small marker file (`--marker <path>`) on startup if asked,
//! so a test can confirm it actually ran without racing on stdout capture.
//!
//! * `--dump <path>` (story 2-2)  write a small observation file at startup: the
//!   full received argv (one `arg=<token>` line each) followed by every
//!   environment variable (one `env=<KEY>=<VALUE>` line each). The engine's
//!   start-seam config mapping proof reads this back to confirm a mapped unified
//!   key landed in the agent's native mechanism — a FLAG in the args, or an ENV
//!   var in the environment — WITHOUT racing on stdout capture. Pure `std`, NO
//!   OS-cfg. (A FILE-target mapping is observed directly as a rendered file in the
//!   Agent Home, so it needs no dump.)
//! * `--emit-usage <N>` (story 3-1)  after announcing readiness, emit `<N>`
//!   self-reported usage sentinel lines — `KTESIO_USAGE {json}` — on stdout, with
//!   monotonic `sequence` 0..N and FIXED token sentinels (`input_tokens = 10`,
//!   `output_tokens = 20` per event), spaced across the loop so the engine's reaper
//!   ingests them into the Usage Ledger. This is the `self-reported` half of FR-19:
//!   the engine parses these captured lines into UsageEvents. Determinism: the test
//!   waits for the KNOWN number of committed rows (the DB is the source of truth),
//!   NOT a wall-clock sleep. Pure `std`, NO OS-cfg (the parser + this emitter share
//!   the documented convention; the OS-cfg gate covers this crate).
//! * `--replay-usage` (story 3-1)  after the `--emit-usage` batch, re-emit
//!   `sequence 0` ONCE (a DELAYED/replayed batch). The engine's ledger dedup must
//!   recognize it and NOT double-count — the AC-A no-double-count proof.
//! * `--usage-input-tokens <N>` / `--usage-output-tokens <N>` (story 3-1)  override
//!   the FIXED per-event token sentinels so a test can emit an arbitrary value —
//!   notably `u64::MAX` — to prove the storage boundary SATURATE-CLAMPS the `u64`
//!   into SQLite's signed `i64` column (a positive `i64::MAX`) rather than a raw
//!   `as i64` that bit-wraps NEGATIVE and poisons the billing SUM (the C1/C2
//!   boundary). Default to the fixed sentinels when absent.
//! * `--final-usage-no-newline` (story 3-1)  after the batch (+ any replay), emit
//!   ONE more usage line WITHOUT a trailing newline (`sequence = emit_usage`), then
//!   exit immediately. The process dies with a half-line in the log, so ONLY the
//!   engine's TERMINAL drain-on-reap can rescue it — the H1 under-count proof (a
//!   mid-run drain, which stops at the last newline, would strand it forever).
//! * `--observed-calls <N>` (story 3-4)  ENGINE-OBSERVED mode: after announcing
//!   readiness, make `<N>` OpenAI-compatible completion requests to the `base_url`
//!   the engine INJECTED into this process's environment (`OPENAI_BASE_URL` — the
//!   env var an `engine-observed` manifest maps `metering.base_url` onto). Each is a
//!   minimal `POST <base_url>/v1/chat/completions`; the engine's loopback forward
//!   listener relays it to a test upstream stub and skims the `usage` out of the
//!   response into the ledger. This is the `engine-observed` half of FR-19: the
//!   agent reports NOTHING itself — the engine OBSERVES its model traffic. A tiny
//!   pure-`std` HTTP/1.1 client (a raw `TcpStream` — NO dependency, NO OS-cfg) makes
//!   the calls, count-bounded so a test waits for `<N>` committed observed rows (the
//!   DB is the source of truth), never a wall-clock sleep. Pure `std`, NO OS-cfg.
