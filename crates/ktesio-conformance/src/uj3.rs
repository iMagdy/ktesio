//! Shared UJ-3 flow expectations (story 7-1) — the ONE place the "host drives
//! the full flow through the library alone" journey's expected values are
//! pinned, and the seam that proves the LIBRARY path and the `kt` CLI path are
//! behaviorally identical.
//!
//! ## Role: test infrastructure, never a driving surface
//!
//! Story 7-1's intent (FR-31): a host links `ktesio-engine` and drives the full
//! UJ-3 flow — register → configure → cap → start → breach → pause → stop —
//! with no CLI, and the SAME flow through documented `kt` commands must pass
//! the SAME assertions. This module owns the shared half of that proof:
//!
//! * the fixture manifest the flow's agent registers under
//!   ([`write_flow_manifest`]),
//! * the flow's config keys/values ([`flow_config_pairs`]),
//! * the budget/rate/cap numbers and the expected token/dollar totals,
//! * assertion helpers over OBSERVED reads (state, breach/transition events,
//!   [`FleetEntry`]/[`UsageView`] rows) — each expectation stated ONCE here,
//!   never re-stated inline by either suite,
//! * the committed-state readers + poller ([`committed_state`],
//!   [`wait_for_state`], [`read_breach_events`], [`read_transition_events`])
//!   copied from the engine's `tests/budget.rs` mechanism so BOTH suites share
//!   it (the engine layout — `state.db` via the engine-published
//!   `paths::STATE_DB_FILE`, `agents/<name>/logs/*.log` — is identical under a
//!   library `Engine::open` root and a `kt` state dir),
//! * the usage-ledger reader + received-stream projection + the raw-receiver
//!   drain ([`committed_usage_rows`], [`usage_from_payload`],
//!   [`drain_receiver`] — the drain now delegating to the shared
//!   `test_support` implementation) — the ONE comparison shape for story
//!   7-2's "the received usage stream equals the committed ledger rows
//!   exactly" guarantee, consumed by both the 7-2 acceptance suite and the
//!   7-3 collision test, and
//! * assertion helpers over OBSERVED reads (state, breach/transition events,
//!   [`FleetEntry`]/[`UsageView`] rows) — each expectation stated ONCE here,
//!   never re-stated inline by either suite.
//!
//! Both consumers dev-depend on this crate; dev-deps never cross the shipping
//! boundary gate (`cargo tree -p ktesio -e normal,build` stays clean). A test
//! imports these helpers to ASSERT; the driving happens exclusively through
//! each suite's own sanctioned surface (the engine's public `Blocking` facade
//! in the host test; documented `kt` commands in the CLI journey). This module
//! is deliberately NOT a driver and offers no way to become one.
//!
//! ## The pinned flow (the numbers, and why they are exact)
//!
//! The fixture agent is the conformance `fake_agent` with `--emit-usage 5`:
//! the proven `budget.rs`/`cost.rs` emission pattern, whose FIXED sentinels are
//! 10 input + 20 output tokens per event (30/event). With the unit Rate
//! (`$1.00`/1M both directions = 1 micro/token) every event costs exactly 30
//! micro-dollars, so:
//!
//! * a cumulative token ceiling of [`TOKEN_CEILING`] (90) breaches at/after
//!   event 3 (`>= 90`) — the TOKEN breach wins the pause (the supervisor
//!   evaluates token ceilings first when both dimensions cross),
//! * a cumulative dollar cap of [`DOLLAR_CAP_DOLLARS`] ([`DOLLAR_CAP_MICROS`]
//!   micros) is armed on the same instance so the flow proves the Rate'd
//!   dollar surfaces honestly; its full enforcement matrix is `cost.rs`'s,
//!   which the shared expectations mirror rather than re-state,
//! * the instance pauses (the ratified default Breach Action) with a
//!   `BudgetExceeded` cause and exactly ONE breach event (the per-Run
//!   idempotence latch), polled against COMMITTED state — never wall-clock.
