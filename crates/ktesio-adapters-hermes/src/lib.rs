//! # ktesio-adapters-hermes
//!
//! Native (in-workspace Rust) adapter for the NousResearch [Hermes Agent],
//! implementing the Adapter Contract from `ktesio-adapter-api` (architecture
//! spine AD-2, AD-3). This is the FIRST launchable native adapter: the engine's
//! builtin table carries its launch (`hermes gateway run --external-supervisor`,
//! foreground under Ktesio's ProcessBackend — verification note CP-b), while a
//! native builtin previously had no process to spawn (the `mock` stays inert).
//!
//! ## Declared shape (story 6-2, ratified from CP-6.1-a…f)
//!
//! - **Pause = BestEffort on every OS** (CP-a): the gateway has no signal-freeze
//!   mechanism; its ESTOP sentinel only stops NEW work. The engine surfaces this
//!   honestly with the `pause-best-effort` / `resume-best-effort` qualifier
//!   causes — no engine change needed.
//! - **Interaction = Guaranteed on every OS** (FR-22): the gateway pipes stdin.
//! - **MeteringSource::SelfReported** (CP-d): usage comes from the agent's own
//!   `/usage` + insights surface; BudgetEvaluator stays additive (no $ cap).
//! - **Config mapping**: ONLY the reserved unified key `memory.dir` → env
//!   [`HERMES_HOME`] (CP-e+f) — the same filesystem-
//!   backing invocation override the builtin mock maps to `KTESIO_MEMORY_DIR`.
//!   The `model` key is deliberately UNMAPPED (Decision 6): Hermes switches
//!   models via its own `hermes model` CLI, so an operator-set `model` value is
//!   delivered nowhere (a silent no-op).

/// pointing each instance at its own home inside its Agent Home satisfies the
/// one-agent-per-home constraint and keeps state inside the managed dir.
