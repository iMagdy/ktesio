//! The async engine handle + its blocking facade (spine AD-13).
//!
//! [`Engine`] is the async-first Embedding Interface. It owns a multi-thread
//! tokio [`Runtime`](tokio::runtime::Runtime), the registration [`Registry`]
//! (an internal collaborator), and the in-memory lifecycle [`Supervisor`]. Its
//! public methods are `async`; the blocking DB/FS work runs on tokio's blocking
//! pool via [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`] (rusqlite is a synchronous C binding
//! that must never run on an async worker — AD-13, Approach A).
//!
//! ## The `blocking()` facade (FR-34 / FR-31 / story 7-3 seed)
//!
//! Sync callers — `kt` today — drive the engine through [`Engine::blocking`],
//! which returns a [`Blocking`] view whose methods are the sync equivalents,
//! each `runtime.block_on(async_method(..))`. `kt` stays a synchronous binary
//! (no `#[tokio::main]`); a Host with its OWN runtime (story 7-1/7-3) calls the
//! async methods directly. This story covers exactly the commands `kt` uses
//! today (register / remove / list / effective-capabilities) plus `start` /
//! `stop`; the FULL facade + the embedding proof are 7-1/7-3.
//!
//! ## No global state, no ambient runtime (AD-13 forward contract)
//!
//! The engine takes its state-dir base explicitly (mirroring [`Registry::open`])
//! and owns its runtime; it never assumes an ambient runtime elsewhere and holds
//! no thread-locals or globals. This is what keeps the facade sound.

//! ## The event subscription (story 7-2, FR-33 / AD-14)
//!
//! A Host OBSERVES the engine through [`Engine::subscribe`], which hands out a
//! [`broadcast::Receiver`](crate::broadcast::Receiver) over the bounded event
//! bus (capacity [`EVENT_BUS_CAPACITY`](crate::EVENT_BUS_CAPACITY)). The bus is
//! fed at the SAME commit points where the event logs are appended — a
//! subscriber sees exactly the committed truth, in commit order, per-instance
//! FIFO — and the payload is the [`EngineEvent`](crate::EngineEvent) wrapper
//! over the EXISTING versioned AD-14 structs verbatim (no new schema family).
//! Slow subscribers are policy, not failure: `send` is non-blocking, so a
//! stalled receiver can never stall supervision; past the capacity it observes
//! `Lagged` and resyncs at the tail (see the `domain::bus` module docs for the
//! full contract). Sync consumers get [`Blocking::subscribe`], whose
//! [`EventSubscription`] owns a blocking `recv` bridged through the engine
//! runtime exactly like every other facade method.

//! ## The diagnostic sink (story 10-2)
//!
//! The engine writes TWO operational diagnostics (the DC-10 memory-delivery
//! notice and the enforcement breadcrumb). By default they go to stderr,
//! exactly as they always have. A host that owns its stderr installs a
//! [`DiagnosticSink`](crate::DiagnosticSink) — any `std::io::Write` — at open
//! ([`Engine::open_with_diagnostics`]) or any time later
//! ([`Engine::with_diagnostics`] / [`Blocking::with_diagnostics`]); the
//! diagnostics then route to the sink, receiving the exact bytes (same
//! `[ktesio] `-prefixed text, one line each) stderr would have received.
//! Installing REPLACES any earlier sink (rotation) and is one-way — there is
//! no uninstall back to the stderr default; a host that wants the default
//! back re-opens the engine. The sink is engine-embedder ergonomics — it
//! never touches the adapter-api contract.

/// async runtime stays alive**, even after the `Engine` (and every facade
/// view of it) has been dropped. This is what makes a subscription usable for
/// the natural drain-at-shutdown pattern (drop the engine, then keep reading
/// the already-published events to the tail); it cannot deadlock or dangle —
/// `recv` simply keeps serving buffered events, and returns
/// `RecvError::Closed` once the buffer is drained and the engine's sender
/// side is gone. The flip side: a host that leaks a subscription leaks the
/// runtime's threads with it. **To release the runtime, drop every
/// [`EventSubscription`] (and then the engine).** A `Weak` handle was
