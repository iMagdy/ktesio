//! Adapter resolution + manifest loading/validation (spine AD-3).
//!
//! This module RESOLVES a requested adapter — a native builtin by kind, or a
//! manifest by path — into a [`ResolvedAdapter`]: a uniform, parsed view the
//! registry consumes (its kind, its effective current-OS Capability
//! Declaration, its Metering Source, and, for manifest adapters, the manifest
//! path 1-4 will need to launch it).
//!
//! ## Boundary: PARSE + VALIDATE only — EXECUTES NOTHING (CRITICAL)
//!
//! The loader reads, parses (via [`ktesio_adapter_api::Manifest`]), and
//! validates. It stores templates and declarations. It does **not** run any
//! lifecycle op, spawn any process, or add tokio — that is story 1-4's manifest
//! executor. The `AgentAdapter` lifecycle methods are never called here; only
//! the declaration accessors are read.
//!
//! ## Schema ownership (AD-3)
//!
//! The engine defines **no** manifest schema. It consumes
//! `ktesio-adapter-api`'s parsed [`Manifest`]/[`CapabilityDeclaration`]/
//! [`MeteringSource`] types. The manifest-adapter view built here is derived
//! entirely from that crate's validated output.
//!
//! ## Native builtins and the conformance boundary
//!
//! The shipping engine resolves native kinds through a small builtin table
//! ([`resolve_native`]). The `mock` kind resolves to an **engine-internal**
//! [`builtin::BuiltinMock`], deliberately NOT the `ktesio-conformance`
//! `MockAdapter`: a normal `engine → conformance` edge would be transitive into
//! `kt` and trip the AD-2 boundary gate. The conformance mock stays a
//! dev/test fixture (imported as a dev-dependency where tests need it); the two
//! share the same declared shape.
