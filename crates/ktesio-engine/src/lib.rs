//! # ktesio-engine
//!
//! Home of the Ktesio engine: agent lifecycle, governance, and interaction
//! logic live here, behind a public API that *is* the Embedding Interface
//! (architecture spine AD-1, AD-2, AD-13).
//!
//! ## What this crate exposes (stories 1.2–1.3)
//!
//! The registration capability (FR-1/FR-2/FR-3), now with adapter resolution
//! and validation (story 1.3, FR-1 path registration / FR-19 metering / FR-27
//! contract seed). The public surface is deliberately small — the registry
//! service, the domain types it returns, and the adapter-contract types `kt`
//! renders:
//!
//! - [`Registry`] — `open`, `register`, `register_with_adapter`, `remove`,
//!   `list`, `get` (the Embedding Interface for registration; `kt` drives these
//!   directly).
//! - [`AdapterRef`] — a native-kind or manifest-path adapter request;
//!   [`ResolvedAdapter`] — the validated adapter view registration persists.
//! - [`RemoveDisposition`] — retain-or-delete choice for `remove`.
//! - [`AgentInstance`], [`InstanceName`], [`LifecycleState`] — returned domain
//!   types.
//! - [`CapabilityDeclaration`], [`EffectiveCapabilities`], [`Capability`],
//!   [`SupportLevel`], [`MeteringSource`], [`OsId`] — re-exported from
//!   `ktesio-adapter-api` so `kt` can render the effective per-OS declaration.
//! - [`RegistryError`] / [`NameError`] — the `thiserror` error surface `kt`
//!   wraps into `miette` diagnostics (no `miette` in this lib — conventions).
//!
//! Adapter resolution PARSES + VALIDATES only; it executes no lifecycle op
//! (story 1.4 owns the manifest executor and process launch).
//!
//! Everything else — the [`StateStore`] port, its SQLite implementation, and
//! the path authority — stays crate-internal (AD-1/AD-2). The `ports` module is
//! `pub` so the *port trait* is nameable by future in-workspace collaborators,
//! but the concrete store is not re-exported.
//!
//! ## Observing the engine: the event subscription (story 7-2, FR-33/AD-14)
//!
//! A Host subscribes via [`Engine::subscribe`] (async consumers, raw
//! [`broadcast::Receiver`]) or [`Blocking::subscribe`] (sync consumers, an
//! [`EventSubscription`] with a blocking `recv`). The bounded bus
//! ([`EVENT_BUS_CAPACITY`]) is fed at the same commit points where the event
//! logs append, so subscribers observe exactly the committed truth in commit
//! order; payloads are the [`EngineEvent`] wrapper over the existing versioned
//! AD-14 structs verbatim. The full contract — commit-point guarantee,
//! per-instance FIFO, the `Lagged` slow-subscriber policy — is documented on
//! the `domain::bus` module.
//!
//! ## Routing engine diagnostics: the host-provided sink (story 10-2)
//!
//! The engine writes TWO operational diagnostics — the DC-10 memory-delivery
//! notice and the enforcement breadcrumb. With no sink installed they go to
//! stderr, byte-identical to every pre-sink release. A host that owns its
//! stderr installs a [`DiagnosticSink`] (any `std::io::Write`, thread-safely
//! wrapped) via [`Engine::open_with_diagnostics`] (in place before any
//! supervision work) or [`Engine::with_diagnostics`] /
//! [`Blocking::with_diagnostics`] (install or rotate later); the diagnostics
//! then route to the sink, receiving the exact bytes — same `[ktesio] `
//! prefixed text, one newline-terminated line each — stderr would have
//! received. The sink is engine-embedder ergonomics only: the adapter-api
//! contract is untouched.
//!
//! ## Healing the crash window: the resync helper (story 10-3)
//!
//! The bus delivers at-most-once in the crash window between a durable append
//! and its publish. [`Engine::resync_events`] /
//! [`Blocking::resync_events`] close that window for hosts: one call reads the
//! instance's COMMITTED event records (transitions, breaches, ledger rows —
//! the same truth the query APIs serve) and returns them as the exact
//! [`EngineEvent`] payloads the live bus carries, past a [`ResyncCursor`] so
//! re-runs are idempotent. The contract is **resync first, then subscribe** —
//! that order gives backfilled-prefix + live-suffix continuity with no gap
//! and no duplicate. Ordering and tolerance details are documented on the
//! `domain::resync` module.
//!
//! ## Dependency law (AD-2)
//!
//! The `kt` binary depends only on this crate's public API (plus
//! `ktesio-adapter-api` types); this crate depends on `ktesio-adapter-api` and
//! never on `kt` or concrete adapters.
//!
//! [`StateStore`]: crate::ports::StateStore
