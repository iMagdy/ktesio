//! The [`StateStore`] port (hexagonal, spine AD-1).
//!
//! Trait methods speak in domain types, never SQL. The SQLite implementation
//! ([`crate::store::SqliteStore`]) sits behind this port; the registry service
//! depends on the trait, not the concrete store.
//!
//! ## Synchronous this story (spine AD-13 is 1.4)
//!
//! These methods are plain synchronous functions. AD-13's async-first engine
//! and `blocking()` facade land in story 1.4; registration/removal are
//! filesystem + SQLite operations with no supervision or concurrency need, so
//! sync is the correct altitude now. The trait takes no runtime handle and
//! holds no global state, keeping it facade-friendly for the 1.4 migration.
