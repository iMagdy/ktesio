//! Hexagonal ports (spine AD-1).
//!
//! Ports are the traits through which all variability enters the engine core.
//! This crate realizes four: [`StateStore`] (persistence), [`ProcessBackend`]
//! (per-OS process control, AD-4 — its per-OS impls live in `backends/`, the sole
//! allowlisted `#[cfg]` home), from story 2-4 [`SecretResolver`] (secret
//! resolution, AD-10 — env + the 0600 secrets file; OS-keychain stays a deferred
//! resolver behind the same port), and, from story 3-1, [`UsageSource`] (the AD-7
//! metering INGESTION seam — the self-reported channel that yields usage from a
//! running instance). Story 3-4 landed the SECOND source, [`ObservedUsageSource`]
//! (`engine-observed`): it is fed by the loopback forward listener
//! (`crate::metering`) and, being event-driven rather than a log-tail drainer,
//! mints its [`ParsedUsage`] directly while yielding the SAME shape into the SAME
//! commit choke point. The remaining port (`MemoryBacking`) arrives with the story
//! that needs it (entity-timing) — no speculative port trees.
