//! The Memory Backing port surface (spine AD-11) — story 5-1.
//!
//! AD-11: *"`filesystem` (engine-managed directory inside the Agent Home;
//! survives restarts byte-identically) and `native` (delegation marker; engine
//! guarantees only Agent Home persistence). Attach/detach permitted only while
//! the Agent Instance is not `running`. The backing descriptor is handed to the
//! adapter at start; richer backings are Deferred behind this port."*
//!
//! ## This module IS the seam — deliberately NOT a trait (A-8)
//!
//! The `filesystem` implementation is pure path authority inside the engine (one
//! idempotent directory creation at attach + one defensive self-heal at start);
//! there is no behavior to dispatch. A trait with one real impl and one marker
//! would be exactly the "speculative port tree" the ports module warns against,
//! so the port is this MODULE: its types are the extension point a richer
//! backing (vector store, tiered, …) lands behind in a later epic.
//!
//! ## Descriptor delivery (AD-11 Delivery clause / Q-1 ruling)
//!
//! The backing "descriptor" rides the EXISTING layered-config seam: at start the
//! engine injects the managed directory path at the reserved unified-config key
//! ([`crate::domain::MEMORY_DIR_KEY`]) as an invocation override, and the
//! adapter's already-declared `[config]` mapping routes it into the agent's
//! native mechanism. Delivery is OFFERED, not imposed — whether the agent
//! receives it is the adapter's declared choice — which is why
//! [`MemoryBackingStatus::declared`] exists: the public read reports whether
//! the resolved mapping actually targets the key.
