//! The AD-14 event bus (story 7-2, FR-33 / AD-14) — the engine's subscription
//! surface: one bounded broadcast channel fed at the SAME commit points where
//! the event logs are appended, handing out [`broadcast::Receiver`]s over a
//! wrapping [`EngineEvent`].
//!
//! ## The contract (what a subscriber may rely on)
//!
//! * **Committed truth only.** Every publish happens immediately AFTER the
//!   durable append/commit succeeds — a transition after its
//!   `instance.log` append, a breach after its `breaches.log` append, a usage
//!   update after its ledger row commits. A subscriber NEVER sees an event
//!   whose durable record failed to land, and never sees one BEFORE its
//!   durable record exists.
//! * **Publish order == commit order (per-instance FIFO).** Every commit point
//!   runs while the caller holds the supervisor lock, so publishes are
//!   serialized in exactly the durable append order. A subscriber observes one
//!   instance's events in the same order its `instance.log` /
//!   `breaches.log` / ledger record them — FIFO in commit order (the channel
//!   order is in fact the GLOBAL commit order, a strictly stronger property).
//!   This ordering is **caller-enforced**: the bus does not serialize by
//!   itself — the guarantee holds because every current publish site runs
//!   under the supervisor lock, and each site carries a pointer comment naming
//!   that obligation. A future publish from OUTSIDE the lock would silently
//!   break the global-order guarantee.
//! * **Versioned payloads, verbatim.** [`EngineEvent`] is a thin
//!   `kind`-tagged wrapper over the EXISTING AD-14 structs —
//!   [`TransitionEvent`], [`BudgetBreachEvent`], and [`UsageUpdateEvent`]
//!   (which carries the committed [`UsageEvent`]) — with NO new schema
//!   vocabulary. Each payload stamps its own `schema_version`
//!   ([`EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`] / [`BUDGET_SCHEMA_VERSION`] /
//!   [`USAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION`]); the wrapper deliberately does NOT duplicate a
//!   version. Serde-derived so a future wire surface can round-trip the same
//!   shapes the query APIs (`transition_events` / `budget_breach_events`)
//!   already return — one event schema, two consumers (AD-14).
//! * **Slow subscribers cannot stall supervision.** The channel is bounded at
//!   [`EVENT_BUS_CAPACITY`] and `broadcast::Sender::send` is synchronous and
//!   non-blocking by construction — a publish NEVER awaits subscriber
//!   capacity, so a stalled receiver cannot back-pressure a transition, a
//!   breach record, or usage ingestion. A receiver that falls more than
//!   [`EVENT_BUS_CAPACITY`] events behind observes
//!   [`broadcast::error::RecvError::Lagged`]`(`n`)` for the `n` dropped
//!   events and then KEEPS WORKING, resynced at the current tail (dropped
//!   events remain in the durable logs — the query APIs read them back).
//!   This is the documented policy, not a failure mode: a lagging host
//!   re-syncs, and what it missed is never lost.
//! * **Publishing failures cannot fail supervision.** `send` returns `Err`
//!   only when there are no receivers at all; the bus swallows that by design
//!   (an unsubscribed engine pays one cheap no-op per event, nothing more).
//!
//! ## Crash-window delivery (honest at-most-once semantics)
//!
//! The durable append and the bus publish are two separate steps, in that
//! order. A process crash in the window between them loses that ONE event
//! from the bus — delivery is at-most-once in the crash window. The durable
//! logs stay COMPLETE either way, and since story 10-3 the remedy is ONE
//! call: [`Engine::resync_events`](crate::Engine::resync_events) /
//! [`Blocking::resync_events`](crate::Blocking::resync_events) backfill the
//! committed records as [`EngineEvent`]s past a
//! [`ResyncCursor`](super::resync::ResyncCursor) (the contract: resync
//! FIRST, then subscribe — see the `domain::resync` module for the ordering
//! and torn-tail tolerance details). The query APIs
//! ([`TransitionEvent`]s via `Engine::transition_events`,
//! [`BudgetBreachEvent`]s via `Engine::budget_breach_events`, ledger reads)
//! remain the narrower per-family reads underneath. The at-most-once WINDOW
//! itself is the documented policy, not a failure mode: closing it in-band
//! would need publish-before-append (violating the committed-truth
//! guarantee) or a durable per-subscriber cursor (a persistence surface the
//! 7-2 review explicitly rejected).
//!
//! ## Boundary (what this is NOT)
//!
//! No wire/HTTP surface, no persistence change, no new event kinds, no `kt`
//! CLI surface. The bus is purely ADDITIVE to the existing query APIs —
//! `Engine::transition_events` / `Engine::budget_breach_events` keep reading
//! the durable logs untouched.
