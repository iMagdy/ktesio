//! Transition events (spine AD-14 SEED) — one schema, two consumers.
//!
//! A [`TransitionEvent`] is the "event" for this story: a RECORDED state
//! transition carrying the prior state, the new state, a cause, and an RFC 3339
//! UTC timestamp. It is a versioned serde struct so story 7-2 (the host
//! subscription bus) and `kt --json` (story 1-7 / 4-3) reuse the SAME schema
//! ("one event schema, two consumers"). [`TransitionEvent::schema_version`] is
//! carried from the start so the schema can evolve compatibly.
//!
//! ## Boundary (what this is NOT)
//!
//! This story SEEDS the struct and RECORDS it (to the per-instance log, and
//! returns it so tests can assert). It does NOT build the bounded-channel
//! subscription bus — that is story 7-2. AC1's "each transition emits an event"
//! is satisfied here by "each transition records a `TransitionEvent`".
