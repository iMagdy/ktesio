//! The lifecycle state machine as DATA (spine AD-15) — the transition table.
//!
//! One place decides "given the current [`LifecycleState`] and a
//! [`LifecycleCommand`], what is the next state (or the uniform error)". The
//! table is a total `match` over the two enums — which IS "data" per AD-15 (a
//! total function over a finite product is a table; no external data file is
//! needed). The supervisor calls [`next_state`] to decide, then persists the new
//! state and emits the transition event. Keeping this function PURE (no I/O, no
//! adapter, no OS) makes it exhaustively unit-testable and keeps the domain core
//! clean (AD-1).
//!
//! ## Command-driven vs event-driven edges (documented shape)
//!
//! `Start`, `Stop`, `Pause`, and `Resume` are OPERATOR **commands** — the rows
//! in [`next_state`]. The remaining edges this story reaches are SUPERVISOR
//! reactions to process events, not commands, and are applied directly by the
//! supervisor (each still persisting + emitting the AD-14 event):
//!
//! * `starting → running`  — adapter ready (process spawned and not immediately dead)
//! * `starting → failed`   — launch error
//! * `stopping → stopped`  — process exited (gracefully or after a forced kill)
//!
//! Modeling only the command edges here keeps the AC4 uniform-error contract
//! precise: `InvalidTransition` is returned for a rejected COMMAND (e.g. `Stop`
//! on `stopped`, `Start` on `running`, `Pause` on `stopped`, `Resume` on
//! `running`), and the event-driven edges never reject (the supervisor only
//! applies them when the corresponding process event has actually happened).
//!
//! ## Reachable this story (1-5 wires `paused`)
//!
//! `registered → starting → running → stopping → stopped`, plus
//! `starting → failed` (launch error) and the `stopped → starting` restart of a
//! previously stopped instance (FR-5: start applies to registered *or* stopped).
//! Story 1-5 wires `paused`: `running --Pause--> paused`,
//! `paused --Resume--> running`, and `paused --Stop--> stopping` (the spine
//! state diagram's `paused --> stopping`, so a paused instance is stoppable).
//! The `running → failed` crash edge + Restart Policy (story 1-6) are
//! intentionally NOT wired; the table's doc lists them so the shape is complete.
