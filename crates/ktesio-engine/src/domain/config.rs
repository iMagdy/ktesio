//! The unified layered-config MODEL (spine AD-9, FR-11) — story 2-1.
//!
//! This is the FOUNDATION of Epic 2. It owns exactly two things, both of which
//! are pure and I/O-free (mirroring [`super::transition`] / [`super::restart`]):
//!
//! * The **deterministic precedence resolver** ([`resolve`]): a total, pure fold
//!   of the four ordered [`ConfigLayer`]s — engine defaults < agent-kind defaults
//!   < Agent Home instance config < invocation overrides — into a single
//!   [`EffectiveConfig`]. A later layer wins for a given key, EVERY time, on
//!   EVERY machine (no clock, no env, no OS). The merge is DEEP / per-leaf: an
//!   instance `a.b` overrides only `a.b`, leaving a kind-level `a.c` intact.
//! * **Write-time validation** ([`validate_write`]): accept a known unified key
//!   OR an `agent.*` pass-through key; reject any other key with the nearest
//!   valid key suggested (a tiny hand-rolled Levenshtein over the known-key set).
//!   Runs BEFORE any persistence, so a rejected `set` touches nothing.
//!
//! ## The ONE forward-design seam (for story 2-3, FR-13)
//!
//! [`resolve`] records, per resolved leaf key, the WINNING [`SourceLayer`] (a tag
//! carried alongside each value in [`EffectiveConfig`]). Story 2-3 renders "each
//! value's source layer" and persists the `EffectiveConfig` snapshot at start;
//! by keeping the tag here, that story is purely ADDITIVE. 2-1 does NOT render or
//! persist provenance — it just does not discard it. This is the only capability
//! 2-1 builds ahead of its own AC, and it is cheap (a tag threaded through the
//! fold).
//!
//! ## Explicitly OUT of scope (later Epic-2 stories)
//!
//! * The per-adapter NATIVE-mechanism mapping (files/env/flags) — **2-2 (FR-12)**.
//!   2-1 only reserves the `agent.*` pass-through namespace + honors the bypass.
//! * Provenance RENDERING + the persisted `EffectiveConfig` snapshot — **2-3
//!   (FR-13)**. 2-1 only leaves the [`SourceLayer`] seam.
//!
//! ## SECRETS masking lives here now (story 2-4, FR-14, AD-10)
//!
//! A `secret:NAME`-prefixed leaf VALUE is classified by [`is_secret_ref`] /
//! [`secret_name`] (beside [`is_pass_through`] / [`pass_through_tail`], same
//! non-empty-child discipline) and MASKED by [`ResolvedValue::display`] — the ONE
//! render path the human table, `config get --json`, AND the persisted
//! `effective-config.json` snapshot all share (2-3 AC8), so this single choke
//! point masks all three at once. Resolution (env + the 0600 secrets file) lives
//! in [`super::super::ports`] / the supervisor, not here: this module stays I/O-free
//! and only CLASSIFIES + MASKS. The resolved cleartext reaches the adapter through
//! the supervisor's start seam ([`super::supervisor`]) via
//! [`super::secret::SecretString::expose_secret`] — display and delivery diverge.
//!
//! The on-disk layer plumbing (loading the instance `config.toml`, the embedded
//! engine defaults, writing a key) lives alongside the registry under path
//! authority — see [`super::registry`]. This module is deliberately I/O-free so
//! the resolver + validation stay exhaustively unit-testable in-process.
