//! Story 7-1 (FR-31): the LIBRARY HOST test — a host that links only
//! `ktesio-engine`'s public API drives the FULL UJ-3 flow
//! register → configure → cap → start → breach → pause → stop with no `kt`
//! and no CLI, asserting every step against the expectations pinned ONCE in
//! `ktesio_conformance::uj3` — the same module the CLI journey test
//! (`crates/kt/tests/agent_cli.rs`) consumes, which is what proves the library
//! path and the CLI path are behaviorally identical.
//!
//! ## Boundary (what drives what)
//!
//! Every state change and every read below goes through [`Engine::open`] +
//! `blocking()` — the sanctioned embedding surface (AD-13), the same surface
//! `kt` itself drives. `ktesio_conformance` is used as TEST INFRASTRUCTURE
//! ONLY (the shared expectations fixture + the committed-state readers): it is
//! a dev-dependency of this suite, never a driving surface, and dev-deps don't
//! cross the shipping boundary gate (`cargo tree -p ktesio -e normal,build`
//! stays clean). The flow's agent is the conformance `fake_agent` fixture —
//! the same proven `budget.rs`/`cost.rs` emission pattern (fixed token
//! sentinels, known event count) — so the shared numbers are exact.
//!
//! ## Reachability inventory (the §4.x capability map, per the frozen spec)
//!
//! * **§4.1 Agent Registration & Fleet** — EXERCISED: manifest registration
//!   (`register_with_adapter`) + the Fleet reads before the flow, after the
//!   breach, and after the stop.
//! * **§4.2 Unified Lifecycle** — EXERCISED: `start`, the breach-driven
//!   `running → paused` with its `BudgetExceeded` cause, and `stop` to the
//!   terminal state.
//! * **§4.3 Unified Configuration** — EXERCISED: `set_config` for every flow
//!   key (the shared pairs) + the `effective_config` read with per-leaf
//!   provenance.
//! * **§4.4 Memory Wiring** — cited, NOT re-tested: its facade reachability is
//!   already proven by the engine's hermes e2e (`tests/hermes.rs` — Phase B
//!   attaches a `filesystem` backing and proves the `HERMES_HOME` delivery
//!   through the same `Blocking` facade; Phase K attaches `native`), so the
//!   flow here does not duplicate it.
//! * **§4.5 Token & Cost Governance** — EXERCISED: the token budget + Rate +
//!   dollar cap armed through config, the breach records (exactly one per
//!   dimension — both armed ceilings cross on the same event; the token
//!   breach wins the pause), and the honest labeled dollar surfaces on every
//!   read.
//! * **§4.6 Unified Interaction** — cited, NOT re-tested: `send_input`'s
//!   facade reachability is already proven by the hermes e2e (Phase C's
//!   `send_input` round-trip; Phase L re-proves interaction on the governed
//!   instance after the whole governance journey).
//! * **§4.7 Adapter Contract & Reference Adapter** — EXERCISED by
//!   construction: the flow registers through a `contract_version = "1.0.0"`
//!   manifest (the contract registration gate negotiates it) carrying the
//!   fixture's per-OS Capability Declaration and Metering Source.
//! * **§4.8 Embeddable Engine** — THIS test is its §4.8/FR-31 discharge: the
//!   whole flow above runs through the Embedding Interface (`Engine::open` +
//!   the `blocking()` facade) with no CLI and no private items, proving every
//!   capability the flow touches is reachable library-alone and behaviorally
//!   identical to the documented `kt` path (the CLI journey in
//!   `crates/kt/tests/agent_cli.rs` feeds the SAME shared assertions).
//! * **§4.9 Agent-Scoped Skills Provisioning** — out of scope (epic 8).
//! * **§4.10 Migration & Deprecation** — out of scope (the legacy-surface
//!   story is epic 8/9 territory; nothing here touches migration).
//!
//! ## Determinism (the budget.rs posture, shared)
//!
//! No wall-clock sleeps against side effects: the fixture emits a KNOWN number
//! of usage events with FIXED token sentinels, the evaluator runs
//! synchronously inside the ingestion path, and every wait polls the COMMITTED
//! state (`uj3::wait_for_state`, the same reader both suites share). The
//! manifest declares pause `guaranteed` on all three OSes, so the default
//! pause Breach Action is a real cross-OS suspension and the committed
//! `paused` state is deterministic everywhere — no `OsId` gate anywhere. All
//! timing comes from the shared module's constants (poll budget, stop
//! window) — never an inline restatement. One honesty note: the POST-STOP
//! ledger is a committed RANGE, not an exact total — the breach's suspension
//! can freeze the emitter at event 3, 4, or 5 (see
//! `uj3::assert_stopped_usage` for the exact shape of the range).
