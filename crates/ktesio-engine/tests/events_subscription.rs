//! Story 7-2 (FR-33 / AD-14): the event-subscription acceptance suite — a Host
//! OBSERVES the engine through `Engine::subscribe()` / `Blocking::subscribe()`
//! and every payload family arrives in commit order with schema-stable shapes.
//!
//! ## The acceptance families (the spec's test core + the triage hardening)
//!
//! 1. **Flow order + payload validation** — a subscriber attached BEFORE the
//!    UJ-3 mini-flow sees every transition, both breach dimensions, and the
//!    usage updates in publish order (== durable commit order), each payload
//!    round-tripping serde into its versioned AD-14 struct, and the received
//!    usage stream equaling the COMMITTED LEDGER ROWS exactly (ordered).
//!    Driven with the SHARED `ktesio_conformance::uj3` fixture (the same
//!    manifest, config pairs, numbers, and committed-state pollers the 7-1
//!    suites pin), not a reinvented one.
//! 2. **Crash/restart leg** — a crashed-then-restarted instance delivers the
//!    `crashed` and `restarted` transitions on the bus, exactly matching the
//!    committed event log.
//! 3. **Slow subscriber: no stall + Lagged** — a receiver that never drains
//!    cannot stall supervision: well over [`EVENT_BUS_CAPACITY`] events
//!    publish (real pause/resume transitions) while the instance keeps
//!    committing; the stalled receiver then observes `Lagged(n)`, and the
//!    events it retains correspond EXACTLY to the durable log's tail (nothing
//!    committed is ever mis-delivered; the dropped prefix stays readable via
//!    the query APIs). A post-lag publish proves the receiver resynced.
//! 4. **Fan-out** — two subscribers each independently receive the full
//!    sequence.
//! 5. **Per-instance FIFO under interleaving** — facade-driven transitions
//!    from two instances interleave on the one bus in exact call order, and a
//!    second pair of instances with OVERLAPPING usage-emission cadences keeps
//!    per-instance FIFO for the usage family against the committed ledger.
//! 6. **Append-failure silence (VG1)** — with a subscriber attached, a failed
//!    durable append (the log file replaced by a DIRECTORY) publishes NOTHING:
//!    the failed event appears on neither the bus nor the durable log, while
//!    the next successful commit delivers. Proven for the transition append
//!    AND the breach append (a failed breach record still enforces — the pause
//!    transition delivers — but no breach event is ever published).
//! 7. **Replay silence (VG2)** — a replayed usage batch (the `metering.rs`
//!    `--replay-usage` pattern) publishes no duplicate: the received usage
//!    stream equals the committed ledger rows exactly.
//! 8. **Async surface (BH3)** — the raw `Engine::subscribe()` receiver driven
//!    from a real `#[tokio::test]` consumer while a plain thread drives the
//!    flow through the facade: every commit arrives over `recv().await`,
//!    bounded.
//!
//! ## Determinism posture (the house style, shared with `budget.rs`/7-1)
//!
//! No wall-clock sleeps against side effects: every flow-driving facade call
//! is synchronous and its publishes complete UNDER the supervisor lock before
//! the call returns, so after a committed-state wait plus ONE supervisor-lock-
//! taking read (the barrier) the channel provably holds every event published
//! so far — a plain `try_recv`-until-empty drain is then exact, never racy.
//! Waits poll COMMITTED state (`uj3::wait_for_state` / `instance_status` /
//! the ledger row count). The one deliberate sleep (the replay settle) is the
//! proven `metering.rs` pattern for this exact fixture and is cited inline.
//! The crash leg tolerates the production 1s restart backoff exactly like
//! `tests/crash.rs` (a single crash, `--crash-times 1`).
