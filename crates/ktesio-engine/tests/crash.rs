//! Integration tests for story-1.6 crash detection + the Restart Policy loop
//! (AC-A / AC5), driven end-to-end through the PUBLIC async [`Engine`] + its
//! background reaper cadence (spine AD-2/AD-13) — spawning the REAL `fake_agent`
//! with `--crash-after-ms` so a genuine process crash is detected and handled by
//! policy, not mocked.
//!
//! These tests exercise the ENGINE's automatic reaper (a tokio interval task).
//! The exhaustive fast-backoff crash-loop / count / reset logic is unit-tested in
//! the supervisor module with an injected schedule (no real seconds); here we
//! prove the wiring works through the real engine: a `never`-policy crash lands
//! `failed` with a `crashed` cause and NO restart, and an `on-failure` crash is
//! automatically restarted by the reaper (observed by the restart count growing
//! and the instance running again). The `on-failure` case tolerates the
//! PRODUCTION 1s base backoff (the first restart waits ~1s) — kept to a single
//! restart so the test stays well under a few seconds.
