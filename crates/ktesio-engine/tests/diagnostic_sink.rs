//! Story 10-2 (Epic 10): the host-provided diagnostic sink.
//!
//! The engine's TWO operational diagnostics — the DC-10 memory-delivery
//! notice and the enforcement breadcrumb — route through a host-provided
//! [`DiagnosticSink`](ktesio_engine::DiagnosticSink) when one is installed
//! (at open via `Engine::open_with_diagnostics`, or any time later via
//! `Engine::with_diagnostics` / `Blocking::with_diagnostics`), and keep their
//! historical stderr behavior when none is. These tests pin the whole
//! acceptance surface:
//!
//! * **Sink receives BOTH diagnostics' exact texts** — driven through the
//!   REAL production paths, not synthetic emissions: the notice via the
//!   attach-unmapped-manifest-then-start path (the DC-10 fault-install), and
//!   the breadcrumb via a budget breach with `breach_action = pause` on an
//!   instance the token breach has ALREADY paused (the dollar dimension then
//!   fails to enforce a second pause — the exact production path the 7-1
//!   suites exercise; the enforcement site evaluates the TOKEN ceilings
//!   first, the pause commits synchronously in the same lock pass, and the
//!   dollar breach's `enforce_pause` hits the already-paused transition
//!   gate). The expected lines are computed from the run itself (the
//!   engine-reported managed dir; the SAME transition-gate error the
//!   enforcement path received, reproduced through the facade), so the
//!   assertions are byte-exact without hardcoding an error string.
//! * **No-sink default is byte-identical to today** — a subprocess re-exec of
//!   this test binary (the `adoption.rs` pattern; std cannot capture a
//!   process's own stderr) runs the SAME flow with no sink and the parent
//!   asserts the child's captured stderr carries exactly the two `[ktesio]`
//!   lines and nothing else — same wording, same stream, one line each.
//! * **With a sink installed, stderr stays silent** — the sink-mode child
//!   drives the same flow with the sink installed; the parent asserts the
//!   child's stderr contains no `[ktesio]` line at all while the sink's
//!   captured bytes (relayed via a file) equal the expected pair exactly.
//! * **The contract corners the docs promise** (the Epic-10 hardening):
//!   mid-flight ROTATION splits the diagnostics across the two sinks (sink A
//!   holds exactly the first line, sink B exactly the second — installing
//!   REPLACES, which an `if diagnostics.is_none()`-shaped install would
//!   silently break); a best-effort write (an always-failing writer is
//!   swallowed and supervision continues); panic recovery (a writer that
//!   panics on its FIRST write is caught — the supervisor mutex never
//!   poisons — and the same sink receives the next diagnostic); and the
//!   shared-Arc shape (one sink `Arc` across TWO engines, both diagnostics
//!   landing in the one capture in call order).
//!
//! Determinism posture (the house style): every wait polls COMMITTED state
//! (the shared `uj3` bounded poller) or the sink's own captured bytes — never
//! a wall-clock guess. No `OsId` gate; runs unmodified on all three OSes.
