//! Integration tests for story-3-2 Token-Budget ENFORCEMENT (AC-A / AC-B / AC-C),
//! driven end-to-end through the PUBLIC async [`Engine`] + its background reaper
//! cadence (spine AD-7) — spawning the REAL `fake_agent` with `--emit-usage` so
//! genuine self-reported usage crosses a configured budget and the supervisor
//! fires the configured Breach Action.
//!
//! ## Robust, cross-OS by construction (retro AI-35/37/38)
//!
//! Like `tests/metering.rs`, these keep a SINGLE in-process `Engine` alive for the
//! whole test — NO cross-lifetime process survival, NO `OsId`-gated skip anywhere
//! (the evaluator + config parse are pure `std`; `fake_agent --emit-usage` is pure
//! `std`). Determinism comes from asserting on COMMITTED LIFECYCLE STATE: the
//! `fake_agent` emits a KNOWN number of usage events with FIXED token sentinels
//! (10 in / 20 out = 30 tokens each), the evaluator runs SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the
//! ingestion path the instant a breaching event commits, so each test POLLS the
//! committed state (the store / the engine reads) until it reaches the expected
//! state — never a wall-clock sleep against a side file. The bulk of the
//! boundary/scope coverage lives in the PURE evaluator unit tests
//! (`domain::budget`); these integration tests prove the end-to-end WIRING.
//!
//! ## Windows posture
//!
//! Every test here runs identically on Linux, macOS, and Windows: the budget is a
//! config value, the evaluator is pure, the breach event is a durable JSON line,
//! and the `stop`/`warn` assertions are OS-agnostic. The DEFAULT `pause` action is
//! exercised with a manifest that declares pause `guaranteed` on all three OSes
//! (the mock's real cross-OS pause backend), and the assertion is on the COMMITTED
//! `paused` state — not on process suspension timing — so it is deterministic
//! everywhere.
