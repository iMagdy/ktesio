//! The embedding quickstart — a complete Ktesio host in one file (story 7-4).
//!
//! This is the copy-paste starting point for embedding the Ktesio engine as a
//! Rust library. It depends on NOTHING but `ktesio-engine` itself — no `kt`,
//! no CLI, no test fixtures, no helper crates — and drives one mini
//! lifecycle: open → register → configure → subscribe → start → observe →
//! stop. The full flow proof (breach, pause, shared assertions) lives in the
//! test suite; this file is the embedder's hello-world.
//!
//! Run it from the repo root with `cargo run -p ktesio-engine --example
//! embedding-quickstart`. The walkthrough lives at docs/embedding.md.
//!
//! ## How it stays hermetic and dependency-free
//!
//! A real host's manifest points `[lifecycle.start]` at its own agent
//! executable. This example has no agent binary, so it is its own agent: it
//! re-executes ITSELF with a sentinel argument, and the agent side of `main`
//! idles until the engine's stop ends the process. The scratch state root is
//! a per-process directory under the OS temp dir, removed best-effort at the
//! end — so the example needs no helper crates at all. One honesty note: the
//! idle cap BOUNDS any orphan to two minutes (it does not prevent one — a
//! crashed host still leaves the agent briefly); the ordinary end is the
//! stop below.
//!
//! Every step asserts with `expect`/`assert_eq!`; a real host should map
//! these into its own error type instead of panicking.
