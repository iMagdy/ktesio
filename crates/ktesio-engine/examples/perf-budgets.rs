//! The performance-budgets harness (story 7-5, NFR-4) — MEASURE, don't assume.
//!
//! NFR-4's budgets — read commands < 1 s on a 25-instance Fleet; supervision
//! overhead ≤ 2% CPU and ≤ 50 MB RSS per running instance — were PRD
//! placeholders marked "for architecture to validate". This harness turns
//! them into measured, gated numbers: it builds a real 25-instance Fleet
//! fixture (manifest agents on the conformance `fake_agent`, a subset
//! RUNNING), drives the PUBLIC facade only (`Engine::blocking()` — the same
//! embedding surface `kt` drives, consistent with stories 7-1/7-3), and
//! measures, in this fixed order (fixture startup is entirely OUTSIDE the
//! timed windows: setup → settle → steady-state window → re-settle → reads):
//!
//! 1. **Steady-state supervision overhead** — with the running subset idling
//!    (`fake_agent --heartbeat-ms 1000` — heartbeat only, no usage emission,
//!    so the engine is supervising, not metering), the ENGINE PROCESS's
//!    aggregate CPU% and RSS are sampled once per second over a ≥ 10 s window
//!    (the first sample is discarded — it carries the phase's residue), AFTER
//!    a settle period. On CI the window runs THREE times and the gate uses
//!    the MEDIAN window (the stability mechanism for noisy shared runners);
//!    locally it runs once. Per-instance = figure / the actually-Running
//!    count sampled at measurement time.
//! 2. **Read latency** — over `READ_ITERATIONS` iterations, each of the read
//!    kinds the CLI itself uses: `fleet()` (the `kt agent list` read),
//!    `instance_status()` (spread across the Fleet round-robin), the
//!    `effective_config()` read (`kt agent config get`; the configured value
//!    is asserted), and the per-instance usage read (`kt agent usage <name>`'s
//!    exact shape: `fleet()` + find — reported as `usage_via_fleet` because it
//!    includes the fleet listing's cost; it is NOT an independent kind).
//!    p50/p95/p99 are reported per kind; the GATE is on the overall p99 (the
//!    worst kind) < 1 s — a STRICT `<` (the budget's own prose): a p99
//!    exactly at 1000.0 ms fails. On CI a failed read gate retries ONCE
//!    after a 30 s cool-down and gates on the second run (the house flake
//!    policy: a co-tenant stall must not red an ordinary PR; local runs are
//!    single-shot).
//! 3. **Subscriber-active overhead (reported, NOT gated)** — NFR-4's gated
//!    figures above are measured with ZERO subscribers; the epic ships a
//!    subscription surface, so after the gated measurements the harness
//!    attaches ONE active subscriber and re-measures a single steady-state
//!    window plus the same read kinds, REPORTING those figures and their
//!    deltas vs the unsubscribed baseline (the report's
//!    `subscriber_overhead` block). Measured-and-reported only: no
//!    ratified subscriber-active budget exists (proposed deferred work), so
//!    these numbers never gate and cannot fail the run. The addendum runs
//!    AFTER the gated phases so it cannot contaminate them, and the startup
//!    liveness check counts its window against the fixture's orphan bound.
//!
//! It prints a machine-readable JSON report to stdout (the measured record —
//! the CI perf-budgets job log is its canonical home, and the job uploads the
//! JSON as a workflow artifact via `PERF_BUDGETS_REPORT_PATH`) and GATES:
//!
//! | gate                        | local + CI | budget                          |
//! |-----------------------------|------------|---------------------------------|
//! | read p99                    | hard       | < 1000 ms                       |
//! | RSS mean / instance         | hard       | ≤ 50 MiB                        |
//! | RSS max spike / instance    | hard       | ≤ 2 × 50 MiB (leak guard)       |
//! | CPU / instance              | hard       | ≤ 2% strict (local)             |
//! | CPU / instance              | hard       | ≤ 2% × `shared_runner_tolerance` (CI) |
//!
//! ## The CI tolerance policy (named, not hidden)
//!
//! `CI_CPU_TOLERANCE_FACTOR` = 1.5. The CPU budget is strict (×1.0) on local
//! runs. GitHub shared runners are noisy neighbors — an unknown co-tenant can
//! steal cycles from under the sampling window — so in CI (the `CI` env the
//! runner sets, overridable with `PERF_BUDGETS_CI=1|0`; any other value exits
//! 2) the CPU gate runs at ×1.5 (3% per instance) AND takes the median of
//! three windows. The factor is a DOCUMENTED shared-runner tolerance, printed
//! in the report (`ci_tolerance.factor`) and in the job log; it is NOT a
//! relaxation of the budget — the 2% strict budget is what local runs gate,
//! reads and RSS gate at budget on every gate platform (ubuntu CI; strict
//! local macOS), and every report carries both the
//! strict-budget margin and the applied tolerance.
//!
//! ## Why an example (explicit gating, not `#[ignore]` sprawl)
//!
//! `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` COMPILES this file and RUNS its
//! `#[cfg(test)]` module (the example's unit tests) but never executes the
//! harness itself — an example's `main` runs only when invoked explicitly.
//! That is the whole gate: the wall-clock measurement stays out of ordinary
//! test runs without a single `#[ignore]`d test, while the GATE MATH
//! (percentiles, worst-kind selection, per-instance normalization, CI-mode
//! parsing, tolerance selection, pass/fail evaluation) is pinned by tests so
//! it cannot silently weaken — a budget change must consciously edit the
//! assertions. Run the harness locally:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --release --example perf-budgets -p ktesio-engine
//! ```
//!
//! (From the workspace root, so the fixture's `fake_agent` exec resolves into
//! the same `target/` — the shared locator's examples/ hop plus its
//! on-demand-build fallback (story 10-1) pin the helper to this binary's
//! target root either way.) The CI perf-budgets job builds the release example
//! + helper explicitly and runs the binary — its regressions FAIL that job.
//!
//! ## Measurement honesty
//!
//! * CPU% is sysinfo's two-refresh delta for ONE pid — the harness process
//!   itself, which owns the `Engine` (its runtime threads + supervisor ARE
//!   the engine; the harness is the embedding host). Between consecutive
//!   refreshes the main thread sleeps, so the sampled CPU is the engine's
//!   idle supervision cost, not measurement-loop cost. sysinfo's process
//!   CPU% can exceed 100 on many cores (it is the per-core SUM) — that is
//!   the "aggregate" figure the budget divides. Both contamination
//!   directions are acknowledged: measuring reads BEFORE the window would
//!   inflate the CPU samples with read-phase activity (the fixed order
//!   measures steady-state FIRST, avoiding it), and the window's own
//!   background leaves the runtime warm for the reads (a short re-settle
//!   absorbs it).
//! * RSS is the engine process's resident set ONLY. The supervised agents'
//!   own memory is their own (separate processes) — per the spec's design
//!   note it is NOT supervision overhead, and the report says so. The mean
//!   is gated, the max is reported and spike-guarded at 2× budget, and the
//!   scope note acknowledges that the allocator may retain pages from
//!   earlier phases (registration/start/sampling) in the engine process.
//! * Window coverage: the 12 s window validates heartbeat-frequency
//!   supervision work (the reaper cadence + per-second log captures).
//!   LONGER-period supervision tasks (sweeps, retention) are NOT captured;
//!   a longer local window is available via `PERF_BUDGETS_WINDOW_MS` (clamped
//!   to [10 s, 1 h]).
//! * Process metrics come from `sysinfo` — the DEV-dependency the spec
//!   record sanctions (dev-only, benchmark-gated, NFR-8-compatible: the
//!   shipping `cargo tree -p ktesio -e normal,build` is unchanged). The
//!   hand-rolled `/proc` alternative would have been platform-lying; Windows
//!   needs the crate regardless.
//! * Platform scope of the gates: enforced on ubuntu CI; strict local gating
//!   on macOS; Windows is measured-and-reported (sysinfo's `memory()` is the
//!   working-set-size analog there) — NEVER a gate platform.
