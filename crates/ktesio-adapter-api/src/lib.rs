//! # ktesio-adapter-api
//!
//! Home of the **Adapter Contract** (architecture spine AD-1, AD-2, AD-3): the
//! types and traits every agent adapter implements, plus the `adapter.toml`
//! manifest schema — defined here and **only** here, versioned independently
//! from the engine under the contract semver.
//!
//! This crate depends on **nothing internal** (spine AD-1): it is pure contract
//! types + the [`AgentAdapter`] trait, with only serde, `toml` (the manifest
//! parser it owns), `semver`, and `thiserror`. The engine depends on this crate
//! and consumes its parsed form; `kt` depends on the engine's public API plus
//! these types.
//!
//! ## What this crate exposes
//!
//! - [`AgentAdapter`] — the Adapter Contract trait (lifecycle op signatures +
//!   declaration accessors).
//! - [`OsId`] — the operating-system identifier resolved as **data** at runtime
//!   ([`OsId::current`]), never via compile-time platform selection (AD-4).
//! - [`Capability`], [`SupportLevel`], [`CapabilityDeclaration`],
//!   [`EffectiveCapabilities`] — the per-OS Capability Declaration and its
//!   projection onto the running OS (AD-4).
//! - [`MeteringSource`] — the declared Metering Source (AD-7). "No viable
//!   source" is modeled as a validation error, not a variant (FR-19 hard line).
//! - [`Manifest`] / [`ManifestError`] — the `adapter.toml` serde schema, with
//!   [`Manifest::from_toml_str`] and [`Manifest::validate`] (mandatory-section +
//!   viable-metering checks, each naming the failing section — AC2/AC4).
//! - [`CONTRACT_VERSION`] — the **frozen Adapter Contract v1** semver
//!   (FR-27/FR-30).
//! - [`negotiate_contract_version`] + [`ContractVersionError`] +
//!   [`COMPATIBILITY_RULE`] — the FR-30 version negotiation the engine enforces
//!   at manifest registration (story 6-6): a manifest loads only when its
//!   declared contract major matches this build's contract major.
//!
//! ## Frozen at v1 (story 6-6)
//!
//! The contract was seeded at 0.1.0 and additively bumped to 0.4.0 while it was
//! still unpublished. Story 6-6 **freezes it as 1.0.0**: from here on the
//! surface is governed by the published versioning + deprecation policy
//! (`docs/adapter-contract.md`) — breaking changes require a major bump and a
//! migration note, deprecations are announced at least one minor ahead, and the
//! engine refuses a manifest whose contract major differs from this build's
//! ([`negotiate_contract_version`]). The `cargo-semver-checks` CI job guards the
//! crate's Rust API; it stays **dormant** (a notice-only notice) until the
//! crates publish at story 7-4 — it provides no protection today, and the docs
//! say so plainly.

/// The Adapter Contract version this build implements (spine FR-27/FR-30 seed).
///
/// A semver string. This SEEDS the versioned contract; it is **not** frozen
/// here (epic 6.6 freezes v1 and adds negotiation). Manifests declare the
/// version they target via `contract_version`; this story stores it, and does
/// not yet negotiate or enforce compatibility beyond presence.
///
/// Bumped `0.1.0 → 0.2.0` in story 2-2 (FR-12): the manifest schema gained an
/// OPTIONAL `[config]` mapping section + the trait's `config_mapping()` accessor —
/// an additive minor bump.
///
/// Bumped `0.2.0 → 0.3.0` in story 3-1 (FR-19 self-reported metering): the
/// Adapter Contract's METERING surface gains a documented usage-reporting CHANNEL —
/// a `self-reported` adapter conveys the agent's own usage accounting to the engine
/// by emitting `KTESIO_USAGE {json}` sentinel lines on the agent's stdout (parsed
/// out of the AD-12 capture; see the [`metering`] module + `docs/manifest.md`). This
/// is a DOCUMENTARY, back-compat addition (no new trait method — the channel is a
/// stdout convention, and the `[metering]` section is unchanged), so it is an
/// additive MINOR bump under 0.x semver: nothing was removed or changed
/// incompatibly. Unlike story 2-4's engine-INTERNAL `SecretResolver` (no bump), this
/// touches the adapter-FACING contract, so the bump is real — the semver-check CI
/// job guards it.
///
/// Bumped `0.3.0 → 0.4.0` in story 4-1 (FR-24 send input): the manifest
/// `[interaction]` block's `channel` field firms up from a free-form `String`
/// to the closed [`manifest::InteractionChannelKind`] enum (single variant
/// `Stdio` this story) — an unrecognized value now fails to PARSE instead of
/// being silently accepted-and-ignored. This is an adapter-FACING, additive/
/// clarifying change (mirrors 3-1's own reasoning): no existing shipped
/// manifest sets a non-`"stdio"` channel today, so nothing breaks; the
/// semver-check CI job guards it.
///
/// **Frozen `0.4.0 → 1.0.0` in story 6-6 (FR-30, the v1 freeze):** the contract
/// is tagged v1 after Stories 6.4/6.5 validated it against a second agent
/// (opencode) and the 6-5 checkpoint ratifications landed. v1 ships the
/// negotiated rule ([`negotiate_contract_version`]: compatible iff the manifest
/// major equals this build's contract major) and the versioning + deprecation
/// policy published at `docs/adapter-contract.md`. The previously-unpublished
/// 0.x seeds are NOT grandfathered: the contract was never released, so no
/// back-compat obligation exists — a manifest still declaring a 0.x version
/// names both versions and fails to load. The `--json` memory wire surface
/// (story 5-2's deferral) landed IN this freeze, so the frozen v1 surface is
/// complete: adding it after the freeze would have been a breaking wire change.
